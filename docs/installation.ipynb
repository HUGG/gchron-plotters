    "\n",
    "Below you will find the steps to install the latest version of the T<sub>c</sub>plotter package from GitHub. If you have difficulty with the installation, we recommend [using Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HUGG/tcplotter/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/tcplotter.ipynb) to create and save plots using T<sub>c</sub>plotter.\n",

    "In addition, tcplotter requires on the following Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- matplotlib-base\n",
    "- scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the required Python libraries have been installed, you can download the T<sub>c</sub>plotter code from GitHub by visiting the [T<sub>c</sub>plotter GitHub page](https://github.com/HUGG/tcplotter), clicking on the **Code** button on the upper right side of the page, and selecting **Download ZIP**. After the download completes, you can extract the files using your preferred software.\n",

    "At this point, you will need to compile the software for calculating the thermochronometer ages using cmake. The details vary for different operating systems, but likely look like something below.\n",
